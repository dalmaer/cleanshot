Detect iOS screenshots in a directory and move them to a special screenshots folder.

I want iOS to store screenshots in a seperate album, because right now I have a mix of app screenshots and family photos.

Dropbox takes my photos and puts them in their "Camera Uploads". This script moves any screen shots to a "Screenshots/iOS Screenshots" directory to separate the streams.
